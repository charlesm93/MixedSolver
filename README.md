# Annex for the "Mixed Solver" paper
Appendix with code for the mixed solver paper.

This repository contains code that was used to compare two methods
to solve differential equations, with the Bayesian inference
software Stan (mc-stan.org). I have included the Stan code, and
the R scripts used to run the computer experiment.

The manuscript is still being drafted and is not (yet) publically
available.

The work here presented was conducted while I was at Metrum
Research Group, LLC (metrumrg.com).
